# VBA-Challenge

The VBA-Challenge repository consists of the following 4 files:
1) Multiple_year_stock_data_Module1_FP.txt - A text file of the VBA script
2) Screenshot_2018_Worksheet_FP.docx - Screenshot of the 2018 tab of the 'Multiple_year_stock_data.xlsm' (post run)
3) Screenshot_2019_Worksheet_FP.docx - Screenshot of the 2019 tab (post run)
4) Screenshot_2020_Worksheet_FP.docx - Screenshot of the 2020 tab (post run)

The assignment was indeed challenging.  I was able to complete it with little assistance.  I did go to office hours to ask questions,
and met once with a tutor with whom I talked through the objective.  But other than that, the code is my own.  It took an immense amount
of trial and error, but now it 'runs with attitude!'.
I did put in a piece of code to ensure that divisibility when calculating 'percent change' never has a 0 in the denominator.  And, yet,
conceptually, this was not needed.  For the denominator here is the stock 'open value', and a stock (from my understanding) cannot open at a
zero-dollar value, by definition.  In keeping with this fact, there are no 'open values' that are 0 (nor less than 0).  I left the 
'no divisibility by 0' failsafe just as a reference for future coding objectives.
In all, although very time-consuming, this was an excellent exercise which has increased my confidence and comfort level with VBA.
